A new version of the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1703626536]Overpowered Byzantium[/url].

This makes it compatible with the current game, as well as fixing/changing some issues the mod had.

Big thanks to Summary for a lot of the changes and new icons!

What is changed compared to the original mod (in no particular order):
- Alert icons fixed
- Parliament bribes fixed
- Culture conversion fixed
- New Byzantium government mechanic
- Renamed both instances of pronoiars, subjects and units, to respectively despotates and akritai
- Depotates (subject pronoiars) can now be landed in the diplomacy screen
- Estate privileges are fixed and updated
- Byzantine naval doctrine is first choice, rather than last, so it is clickable
- Lots of modification additions and changes
- Mission tree is much larger and some missions are expanded
- Heir event is improved (more op)
- Holy orders in states are buffed, now the first one feels the best just in most cases instead of always
- More flagship modifiers
- All mod files (should) now properly work together with the latest patch (1.37.5.0)
- Roman Empire now properly gets all the buffs and mechanics Byzantium has
- Cossacks are available as an estate from the start, and have their own buff
- Lots of localisation added and changed to make it feel more immersive
- A lot of beautiful new icons, made by Summary
- Small changes to reforms
- New Great Project in Constantinople (hidden behind a mission)
- Decision to add all provinces as seats in parliament
- Propagate religion is fixed
- Lots of localisation added and improved

In addition the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3270921653]Modifiers sorting and coloring[/url] has been integrated in this mod.
We did not get a response from the author after reaching out, but as they have permitted integrations in the past we are assuming it is fine.
For the author of MSAC: if not, please let us know!

Word of warning:
This mod has been made with the assumption the player has all DLC. If you do not, not all parts of the mod may be working properly.
At least for the missions you need the King of Kings DLC, and a lot of other mechanics are also not playable without their respective DLCs.

Future plans:
- Factions currently have no interaction through gameplay, would love to see that having a role
- Encouraging the player to play with despotates
- Reworking the mission tree so it makes sense / is not doubled
- Reworking the mission tree so players without King of Kings get at least a basic byzantine tree
- Find a way to prevent clicking and scrolling 300 times per parliament decision. Maybe cap it at a lower amount in some way
